# DECISION REGISTER

Record of engineering decisions with lasting consequences. Entries are
append-only: a decision is never edited or removed, only superseded by a
later entry that references it.

**Entry format:**

```
## D-NNN — <short title>
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Status: Accepted | Superseded by D-NNN
- Context: why the decision was needed
- Decision: what was decided
- Consequences: what this binds or unblocks
```

## D-001 — Adopt entry-point documentation structure

- Date: 2026-07-15
- Status: Accepted
- Context: Engineering doctrine will grow to hundreds of pages; a single
  README cannot hold it and remain maintainable.
- Decision: The README is the entry point only. Doctrine is split into
  the Engineering Constitution (stable rules), AI Instructions
  (operating manual), versioned specifications (one active), roadmaps
  (per milestone), and research registers, all under `/docs`.
- Consequences: Exactly one specification is marked
  `ACTIVE_SPECIFICATION` at a time; superseded revisions are archived in
  place. README baseline updates are made by proposal at milestone
  boundaries, never silently.
